This app is aimed at students as it includes a pomodoro timer which trackes how long you spend on a task and schedules the time for breaks according to the pomodoro technique. It also allows users to set goals and daily targets to track how long they spend on each task. For example if they wanted to spend an hour a day on a subject, they could create that as a task and a daily target time, work in 25 minute segments with a 5 minute break after each.

There are a number of features here that are quite interesting, including the code for the pomodoro timer and resetting the daily target time each day. There was also the challenge of having the starting target time and the time left after the timer had run.
